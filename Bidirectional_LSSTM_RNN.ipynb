[Three days after the leftist filmmaker, and avowed Kaepernick supporter, took to Instagram to thank Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll for signing Colin Kaepernick, a report has emerged that the Seahawks in fact have no intention of signing Colin Kaepernick.  According to Pro Football Talk, \\u201cPat Kirwan of SiriusXM NFL Radio said today that he doesn\\u2019t expect the Seahawks to sign Kaepernick. That\\u2019s particularly noteworthy because Kirwan has a long and close relationship with Seahawks coach Pete Carroll, dating to their time together when Carroll was defensive coordinator and then head coach of the Jets from 1990 to 1994. Kirwan didn\\u2019t say Carroll was the source of his belief that Kaepernick won\\u2019t be a Seahawk, but it seems unlikely that Kirwan would have bad information about the team his old friend coaches. \\u201d Seattle, much like San Francisco, is one of the biggest liberal outposts on the left coast. Considering the activism of players like Doug Baldwin, and the fact that Pete Carroll himself is a   truther and an Iraq war critic to boot, if Seattle ever truly had interest in Kaepernick it\\u2019s unlikely that interest would have evaporated over Kaepernick\\u2019s politics or because of a perceived backlash over his politics. What\\u2019s more likely is that Kaepernick and the Seahawks couldn\\u2019t agree on financial terms. Seattle doesn\\u2019t have a ton of cap space and Kaepernick probably doesn\\u2019t want to play for the veteran minimum, especially considering that he could likely find himself in a much more powerful financial bargaining position later, should a team lose a starter and all of a sudden become desperate for a starting quarterback. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn\",\n          \"A single concussion experienced by a child or teenager may have lasting repercussions on mental health and intellectual and physical functioning throughout adulthood, and multiple head injuries increase the risks of later problems, according to one of the largest, most elaborate studies to date of the impacts of head trauma on the young. You cannot be an athlete, parent of an athlete, sports fan or reader of this newspaper and not be aware that concussions appear to be both more common  \\u2014   and more dangerous  \\u2014   than most of us once thought. According to a report released last week by the health insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield, based on data from medical claims nationwide, the incidence of diagnosed concussions among people under the age of 20 climbed 71 percent between 2010 and 2015. The rates rose most steeply among girls, with the incidence soaring by 119 percent during that time, although almost twice as many concussions over all were diagnosed in boys. The report acknowledges that the startling increase may partly reflect a growing awareness of the injury among parents, sports officials and physicians, which has led to more diagnoses. But the sheer numbers also suggest that more young people, particularly young athletes, are experiencing head injuries than in the past. Similar increases have been noted among young people in other nations. But the consequences, if any, for their health during adulthood have largely remained unknown. So for the new study, which was funded primarily by the Wellcome Trust and published in August in PLOS Medicine, scientists from Oxford University, Indiana University, the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and other universities turned to an extensive trove of data about the health of people in Sweden. A plethora of linked registries in that nation contain information about people\\u2019s medical and hospital visits, socioeconomic status, education, physical disabilities and other aspects of their lives, says Dr. Seena Fazel, a professor of forensic psychiatry at Oxford and the new study\\u2019s senior author. The registries also allow researchers to compile information about family members. In this case, the scientists concentrated on all Swedes born between 1973 and 1985 and looked for those who had experienced a head injury of some kind before the age of 25. More than 104, 000 people qualified. The researchers pulled data about these people for 40 years or until someone had either died or emigrated from Sweden. For each participant, the researchers also compiled comparable medical and other records for a sibling who had never been given a diagnosis of a head injury and compared outcomes both between family members and against the full population of the country. The results were discomfiting. Young people who had experienced a single diagnosed concussion  \\u2014   which the researchers categorized as a mild traumatic brain injury  \\u2014   were much more likely than the nation\\u2019s general population and than their own siblings to be receiving medical disability payments as adults. They also were significantly more likely to have sought mental health care and much less likely to have graduated from high school or to have attended college than their uninjured brother or sister. And they were about twice as likely as an uninjured sibling to die prematurely. The possibility of lingering physical or psychological problems during adulthood rose precipitously, the researchers found, if someone had experienced more than one concussion while young, or if his or her brain injury had been more severe than a concussion. The outcomes also generally were worse if someone had experienced head trauma after the age of 15, probably because the brain is less resilient than in earlier childhood, Dr. Fazel says. (The researchers did not quantify the causes of the injuries in this study, but past research shows that in the very young, he says, brain injuries usually result from falls, with sports becoming the primary cause in teenagers, and auto accidents the main cause among young adults.) There was, thankfully, encouraging news squirreled away within the data. While young people who had been hit in the head displayed heightened risks for physical and psychological difficulties as adults, most, in fact, were fine. \\u201cThe majority of individuals who had diagnoses of brain injury in our study did not experience adverse outcomes,\\u201d Dr. Fazel says. Unfortunately, it is impossible at the moment to identify which children or teenagers who experience head trauma may be most at risk of struggling in later life and which will instead recover without apparent complications, he says. So the message of this study further underscores that, whenever possible, we should take steps to prevent childhood head injuries. While \\u201cthere are lots of benefits from sports,\\u201d Dr. Fazel says, it may be important to consider changes to the rules or equipment in contact sports, like football and soccer, to try to reduce head trauma. If a young person does suffer head trauma, he continues, more and   monitoring is also probably a good idea. Such monitoring may be especially important if the child shows any signs of \\u201ca decline in psychosocial performance,\\u201d he says, such as a drop in grades or a change, even subtle, in personality. A neurologist can provide useful assessments, and regular   neurological assessments may need to be continued, even into adulthood.\",\n          \"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\\u2019s the  .) Good evening. Here\\u2019s the latest. 1. Hillary Clinton\\u2019s diagnosis of pneumonia has grounded her for a few days and shifted the focus of the presidential race to the candidates\\u2019 health. Mrs. Clinton, 68, and Donald Trump, 70, have promised to release more detailed information from their doctors. The issue isn\\u2019t just their state of vigor but whether they operate with more insularity than transparency. Mr. Trump also demanded that Mrs. Clinton apologize for calling some of his supporters \\u201cdeplorables\\u201d and released an ad showcasing the remarks on national cable and in four battleground states. _____ 2. President Obama will veto a bill that would allow the families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for any role in the plot, the White House said. Since both the House and Senate passed the legislation with majorities, the president could face the first veto override of his presidency. He also met with congressional leaders, above, to discuss measures needed to finance the government after the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, since lawmakers have not agreed on a budget. _____ 3. The U. N. secretary general, Ban   is racing to get the Paris climate agreement into effect  \\u2014   possibly even before the U. S. election. The pact goes into force when 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global emissions formally sign on, conditions that are more than halfway met. The world\\u2019s three largest emitters  \\u2014   the U. S. China, above and Brazil  \\u2014   are on board. This year is shaping up to be the third consecutive hottest on record, and some scientists warn that the oceans\\u2019 ability to absorb excess heat has masked the scale of the problem. These graphics lay out the issues. _____ 4. The N. C. A. A. made a surprise announcement: All its championships are being moved from North Carolina for this academic year because the state passed laws the group said violated the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. The N. B. A. already moved next February\\u2019s   Game from Charlotte, and stars like Bruce Springsteen and Itzhak Perlman have canceled concerts in the state. _____ 5. Florida\\u2019s offer of free Zika testing for pregnant women has increased rather than decreased their anxieties. That\\u2019s because so many responded that state labs are overwhelmed, and the wait for results can stretch to six weeks, complicating already difficult decisions about possibly terminating pregnancies. Above, workers went door to door to take blood samples. _____ 6. Colin Kaepernick, above right, and his teammate Eric Reid knelt during the national anthem before the San Francisco 49ers played their first game of the season against the Los Angeles Rams (10:20 p. m. Eastern, ESPN). Kaepernick\\u2019s refusal to stand for the anthem to protest racial injustice has emboldened players on other teams  \\u2014   and in other sports  \\u2014   to make their own symbolic gestures of dissent. Such moves have been rare, in part because athletes are often preoccupied with team morale and financial and branding issues. _____ 7.

Feel whipsawed by the shift in the last few years from demonizing fat for health problems to blaming sugar? Historical documents discovered by a researcher show that the sugar industry paid several Harvard scientists in the 1960s to play down the link between sugar and heart disease and promote saturated fat as the culprit instead. \\u201cThey were able to derail the discussion about sugar for decades,\\u201d said a medical professor who helped bring the case to light. _____ 9. The Syrian   called for in an agreement by the U. S. and Russia had an uneven start. Violations were reported in the north and south of the country shortly after it went into effect. The timing coincided with Eid   the Muslim Feast of the Sacrifice, which commemorates a story central to Judaism, Christianity and Islam: Abraham\\u2019s willingness to sacrifice his son at God\\u2019s behest. One Syrian activist, pessimistic that the   would make any difference in the conflict, posted on Facebook: \\u201cand they gathered like sheep in front of the guillotine. \\u201d _____ 10. Millions of people are flowing over   paths in Saudi Arabia for the annual hajj. One of them is our Mideast reporter Diaa Hadid, and she\\u2019s sending dispatches, videos and photos to help demystify the pilgrimage for  . There are little prayer counters, like spiritual Fitbits shopping sprees ritual haircuts and moments of great kindness, like being sprayed under a sweltering sun with the last ounces of water from strangers\\u2019 bottles. _____ 11. Finally, this may hearten many Medicare beneficiaries: Claims for skilled nursing, home health care or outpatient therapy are not supposed to be rejected just because a patient has ceased to improve. In fact, a federal judge has ordered supervisors to do a better job of making that clear to health care providers and claims adjudicators. The actual rule is that Medicare must approve such services when they are \\u201cnecessary to maintain the patient\\u2019s current condition or prevent or slow further deterioration. \\u201d _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.

Meghan Aguilar says investigators were called to the scene before dawn Wednesday. \\nBy mid-morning, an LAPD spokesperson at the scene told FOX411 the Chamber of Commerce was sending out a crew in the hopes of getting the star repaired as soon as possible. \\n\\u201cInvestigators are looking at [a] felony vandalism [charge] because of the value which the Chamber of Commerce has placed [on the star] at $2,500\\u2026\\u201d the spokesperson told us. \\u201cAs soon as investigators can positively identify the suspect, which they are very sure they can do\\u2026 they will go ahead and make a decision whether they want to arrest that suspect or seek a warrant.\\u201d \\nFox411 spoke with a worker from Top End Construction who told them that the damage done to Trump\\u2019s star was \\u201cprobably the worst I have seen.\\u201d \\nA man named Jamie Otis has taken responsibility for the destruction, according to Deadline Hollywood, which posted a video of the man taking a pickax to Trump\\u2019s star. \\nAccording to Deadline, Otis planned to auction off the star and give the money to the 11 women who have come forward with groping allegations against Trump just weeks before the presidential election. \\nTrump has denied the groping allegations and it\\u2019s painfully obvious that they are almost assuredly politically motivated . As far as what the women get out of it, some may be politically motivated themselves and others have had their ulterior motives \\u2014 money , fame, payback because Trump didn\\u2019t go to their restaurant, etc. \\u2014 exposed. \\nHollywood Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Leron Gubler made it clear that his organization \\u201cintends to prosecute to the full extent of the law,\\u201d whoever is found to be responsible for the damage.\\u201d \\n\\u201cThe Hollywood Walk of Fame is an institution celebrating the positive contributions of the inductees,\\u201d Gubler stated. \\u201cWhen people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark.\\u201d \",\n          \"Donald J. Trump publicly retreated from his \\u201cbirther\\u201d campaign on Friday, tersely acknowledging that President Obama was born in the United States  \\u2014   and effectively conceding that the conspiracy theory he had promoted for years was baseless. Mr. Trump made no apology for and took no questions about what had amounted to a    smear of the nation\\u2019s first black president. Instead, he claimed, falsely, that questions about Mr. Obama\\u2019s citizenship were initially stirred by the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, in her unsuccessful primary contest against Mr. Obama in 2008. Still, Mr. Trump\\u2019s brief remarks, tacked on to the end of a campaign appearance with military veterans at his new hotel in downtown Washington, represented a sharp reversal from a position he had publicly maintained, over howls of outrage from all but the   extreme of the political spectrum, since 2011. \\u201cPresident Barack Obama was born in the United States, period,\\u201d Mr. Trump said. \\u201cNow, we all want to get back to making America strong and great again. \\u201d Earlier Friday, Mr. Trump sought to stoke interest in his eventual statement on his birther views, telling Fox Business that he would save his views for the   event at his hotel because \\u201cwe have to keep the suspense going. \\u201d Mr. Trump\\u2019s embrace of and refusal to disavow the birther issue helped drive his standing among black voters to historically low levels, with some public opinion polls showing him supported by zero percent of  . Given his other racially incendiary statements, Mr. Trump\\u2019s aides privately say they fear he will be unable to shake free of charges that he is racist, a label that has stuck to him with deleterious effect, polls show. Mindful that the birther issue could also haunt Mr. Trump in his first debate with Mrs. Clinton, on Sept. 26, his aides tried for several days to put it to rest. But Mr. Trump himself revived the issue late Thursday, declining in an interview with The Washington Post to acknowledge that Mr. Obama was born in Hawaii. In his brief remarks, Mr. Trump leveled the accusation  \\u2014   which his supporters have been pressing for weeks  \\u2014   that Mrs. Clinton first raised doubts eight years ago about Mr. Obama\\u2019s birthplace. \\u201cHillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy,\\u201d Mr. Trump said. \\u201cI finished it. \\u201d During the 2008 Democratic contest, a senior strategist for Mrs. Clinton at one point pondered, in an internal memo that was later leaked, the ways in which Mr. Obama\\u2019s personal background differed from those of many Americans. But contrary to Mr. Trump\\u2019s assertion, neither Mrs. Clinton nor her campaign ever publicly questioned Mr. Obama\\u2019s citizenship or birthplace. The topic was such a fringe issue within the Republican Party that in 2011, conservatives, including Ann Coulter, now a vocal Trump supporter, called on Mr. Trump to stop pursuing it. Mr. Trump\\u2019s aides, in a statement late Thursday, tried to argue that he had actually \\u201cended\\u201d the birther issue. Mr. Trump\\u2019s spokesman, Jason Miller, asserted  \\u2014   also falsely  \\u2014   that Mr. Trump had \\u201cobtained\\u201d Mr. Obama\\u2019s birth certificate the president actually released the   version in 2011. \\u201cMr. Trump did a great service to the president and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised,\\u201d Mr. Miller said. Mr. Trump\\u2019s remarks on Friday came after Mr. Obama, in a brief exchange with reporters at the White House, again expressed scorn for the subject. \\u201cI was pretty confident about where I was born,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI think most people were as well. My hope would be that the presidential election reflects more serious issues than that. \\u201d Two of Mr. Trump\\u2019s top advisers  \\u2014   his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York  \\u2014   said in recent days that Mr. Trump had come to believe that Mr. Obama was born in the United States. But Mr. Trump refused to say so. \\u201cI\\u2019ll answer that question at the right time,\\u201d Mr. Trump said in the Washington Post interview. \\u201cI just don\\u2019t want to answer it yet. \\u201d The Clinton campaign made clear that it would not let Mr. Trump slide on the subject. In a speech to the  Black Women\\u2019s Agenda symposium in Washington on Friday  \\u2014   before Mr. Trump made his statement  \\u2014   Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump owed Mr. Obama and the country an apology. \\u201cFor five years he has led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president,\\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \\u201cHis campaign was founded on this outrageous lie. \\u201d She added, \\u201cThere is no erasing it in history. \\u201d Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said Mr. Trump was making such pronounced racial attacks that critics had struggled to adjust. \\u201cOne of things that we are all used to in this business is dog whistles,\\u201d Mr. Clyburn said. \\u201cBut the thing that we are not used to, and I\\u2019m finding it very difficult to get used to, are the howls of wolves. These are howls. These are not whistles. \\u201d Mr. Trump must improve his standing with suburban moderates who shrink from backing someone accused of racism. But his remarks on Friday seemed unlikely to make much of a dent. Connie Keys, 54, a    mother in Montclair, N. J. said Mr. Trump still seemed not to accept Mr. Obama as presidential. \\u201cHe makes it sounds like, \\u2018I should be thanked, I should be applauded, because I\\u2019m the one who finally told the country that the president was born here,\\u2019 when in fact the voters decided that for themselves when we elected President Obama twice,\\u201d said Ms. Keys, who is white. The birther issue brought Mr. Trump attention and vaulted him to the front of Republican primary polls in 2011 as he considered a White House bid. He claimed, without ever offering evidence, that he had hired investigators, and said they \\u201ccannot believe what they\\u2019re finding. \\u201d Mr. Obama, frustrated by the degree to which questions about his citizenship were spreading and attention was being diverted from federal budget discussions, released his   birth certificate that April. \\u201cWe do not have time for this kind of silliness,\\u201d he said. Mr. Trump, who was en route to New Hampshire for a political trip at the time, took a victory lap. \\u201cI am really honored, frankly, to have played such a big role in hopefully, hopefully, getting rid of this issue,\\u201d he told reporters. But he still refused to accept that Mr. Obama\\u2019s birth certificate was authentic. \\u201cWe have to look at it to see if it\\u2019s real,\\u201d he said. On Friday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, said he was glad that Mr. Trump \\u201cnow rejects the crazy idea President Obama wasn\\u2019t born in America. \\u201d But he warned that this would not end the discussion. \\u201cThe problem he\\u2019ll have is that he was a leader of this movement,\\u201d Mr. Graham said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think he did the country a service, himself a service or the party a service by pushing this so hard and so long. \\u201d Democrats seized on Mr. Trump\\u2019s remarks as a litmus test for Republican candidates. \\u201cHe continues to disqualify himself, and yet Republican Senate candidates continue to stand by his side,\\u201d said Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. She said Republican candidates needed to say \\u201cif they think Donald Trump should apologize to the American people for the absurd lies he has spread about President Obama and why they continue to support a campaign that provides a safe harbor for this type of disgusting race baiting. \\u201d Mr. Trump took no questions after his remarks about Mr. Obama. As reporters shouted questions, he smiled and left the room. Not long after, the structure holding up the curtain that had provided a backdrop for his remarks collapsed, sending American flags toppling to the ground. No one was hurt.\",\n          \"\\u2039 \\u203a Arnaldo Rodgers is a trained and educated Psychologist. He has worked as a community organizer and activist.

Meghan Aguilar says investigators were called to the scene before dawn Wednesday. \\nBy mid-morning, an LAPD spokesperson at the scene told FOX411 the Chamber of Commerce was sending out a crew in the hopes of getting the star repaired as soon as possible. \\n\\u201cInvestigators are looking at [a] felony vandalism [charge] because of the value which the Chamber of Commerce has placed [on the star] at $2,500\\u2026\\u201d the spokesperson told us. \\u201cAs soon as investigators can positively identify the suspect, which they are very sure they can do\\u2026 they will go ahead and make a decision whether they want to arrest that suspect or seek a warrant.\\u201d \\nFox411 spoke with a worker from Top End Construction who told them that the damage done to Trump\\u2019s star was \\u201cprobably the worst I have seen.\\u201d \\nA man named Jamie Otis has taken responsibility for the destruction, according to Deadline Hollywood, which posted a video of the man taking a pickax to Trump\\u2019s star. \\nAccording to Deadline, Otis planned to auction off the star and give the money to the 11 women who have come forward with groping allegations against Trump just weeks before the presidential election. \\nTrump has denied the groping allegations and it\\u2019s painfully obvious that they are almost assuredly politically motivated . As far as what the women get out of it, some may be politically motivated themselves and others have had their ulterior motives \\u2014 money , fame, payback because Trump didn\\u2019t go to their restaurant, etc. \\u2014 exposed. \\nHollywood Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Leron Gubler made it clear that his organization \\u201cintends to prosecute to the full extent of the law,\\u201d whoever is found to be responsible for the damage.\\u201d \\n\\u201cThe Hollywood Walk of Fame is an institution celebrating the positive contributions of the inductees,\\u201d Gubler stated. \\u201cWhen people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark.\\u201d \",\n          \"Donald J. Trump publicly retreated from his \\u201cbirther\\u201d campaign on Friday, tersely acknowledging that President Obama was born in the United States  \\u2014   and effectively conceding that the conspiracy theory he had promoted for years was baseless. Mr. Trump made no apology for and took no questions about what had amounted to a    smear of the nation\\u2019s first black president. Instead, he claimed, falsely, that questions about Mr. Obama\\u2019s citizenship were initially stirred by the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, in her unsuccessful primary contest against Mr. Obama in 2008. Still, Mr. Trump\\u2019s brief remarks, tacked on to the end of a campaign appearance with military veterans at his new hotel in downtown Washington, represented a sharp reversal from a position he had publicly maintained, over howls of outrage from all but the   extreme of the political spectrum, since 2011. \\u201cPresident Barack Obama was born in the United States, period,\\u201d Mr. Trump said. \\u201cNow, we all want to get back to making America strong and great again. \\u201d Earlier Friday, Mr. Trump sought to stoke interest in his eventual statement on his birther views, telling Fox Business that he would save his views for the   event at his hotel because \\u201cwe have to keep the suspense going. \\u201d Mr. Trump\\u2019s embrace of and refusal to disavow the birther issue helped drive his standing among black voters to historically low levels, with some public opinion polls showing him supported by zero percent of  . Given his other racially incendiary statements, Mr. Trump\\u2019s aides privately say they fear he will be unable to shake free of charges that he is racist, a label that has stuck to him with deleterious effect, polls show. Mindful that the birther issue could also haunt Mr. Trump in his first debate with Mrs. Clinton, on Sept. 26, his aides tried for several days to put it to rest. But Mr. Trump himself revived the issue late Thursday, declining in an interview with The Washington Post to acknowledge that Mr. Obama was born in Hawaii. In his brief remarks, Mr. Trump leveled the accusation  \\u2014   which his supporters have been pressing for weeks  \\u2014   that Mrs. Clinton first raised doubts eight years ago about Mr. Obama\\u2019s birthplace. \\u201cHillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy,\\u201d Mr. Trump said. \\u201cI finished it. \\u201d During the 2008 Democratic contest, a senior strategist for Mrs. Clinton at one point pondered, in an internal memo that was later leaked, the ways in which Mr. Obama\\u2019s personal background differed from those of many Americans. But contrary to Mr. Trump\\u2019s assertion, neither Mrs. Clinton nor her campaign ever publicly questioned Mr. Obama\\u2019s citizenship or birthplace. The topic was such a fringe issue within the Republican Party that in 2011, conservatives, including Ann Coulter, now a vocal Trump supporter, called on Mr. Trump to stop pursuing it. Mr. Trump\\u2019s aides, in a statement late Thursday, tried to argue that he had actually \\u201cended\\u201d the birther issue. Mr. Trump\\u2019s spokesman, Jason Miller, asserted  \\u2014   also falsely  \\u2014   that Mr. Trump had \\u201cobtained\\u201d Mr. Obama\\u2019s birth certificate the president actually released the   version in 2011. \\u201cMr. Trump did a great service to the president and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised,\\u201d Mr. Miller said. Mr. Trump\\u2019s remarks on Friday came after Mr. Obama, in a brief exchange with reporters at the White House, again expressed scorn for the subject. \\u201cI was pretty confident about where I was born,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI think most people were as well. My hope would be that the presidential election reflects more serious issues than that. \\u201d Two of Mr. Trump\\u2019s top advisers  \\u2014   his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York  \\u2014   said in recent days that Mr. Trump had come to believe that Mr. Obama was born in the United States. But Mr. Trump refused to say so. \\u201cI\\u2019ll answer that question at the right time,\\u201d Mr. Trump said in the Washington Post interview. \\u201cI just don\\u2019t want to answer it yet. \\u201d The Clinton campaign made clear that it would not let Mr. Trump slide on the subject. In a speech to the  Black Women\\u2019s Agenda symposium in Washington on Friday  \\u2014   before Mr. Trump made his statement  \\u2014   Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump owed Mr. Obama and the country an apology. \\u201cFor five years he has led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president,\\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \\u201cHis campaign was founded on this outrageous lie. \\u201d She added, \\u201cThere is no erasing it in history. \\u201d Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said Mr. Trump was making such pronounced racial attacks that critics had struggled to adjust. \\u201cOne of things that we are all used to in this business is dog whistles,\\u201d Mr. Clyburn said. \\u201cBut the thing that we are not used to, and I\\u2019m finding it very difficult to get used to, are the howls of wolves. These are howls. These are not whistles. \\u201d Mr. Trump must improve his standing with suburban moderates who shrink from backing someone accused of racism. But his remarks on Friday seemed unlikely to make much of a dent. Connie Keys, 54, a    mother in Montclair, N. J. said Mr. Trump still seemed not to accept Mr. Obama as presidential. \\u201cHe makes it sounds like, \\u2018I should be thanked, I should be applauded, because I\\u2019m the one who finally told the country that the president was born here,\\u2019 when in fact the voters decided that for themselves when we elected President Obama twice,\\u201d said Ms. Keys, who is white. The birther issue brought Mr. Trump attention and vaulted him to the front of Republican primary polls in 2011 as he considered a White House bid. He claimed, without ever offering evidence, that he had hired investigators, and said they \\u201ccannot believe what they\\u2019re finding. \\u201d Mr. Obama, frustrated by the degree to which questions about his citizenship were spreading and attention was being diverted from federal budget discussions, released his   birth certificate that April. \\u201cWe do not have time for this kind of silliness,\\u201d he said. Mr. Trump, who was en route to New Hampshire for a political trip at the time, took a victory lap. \\u201cI am really honored, frankly, to have played such a big role in hopefully, hopefully, getting rid of this issue,\\u201d he told reporters. But he still refused to accept that Mr. Obama\\u2019s birth certificate was authentic. \\u201cWe have to look at it to see if it\\u2019s real,\\u201d he said. On Friday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, said he was glad that Mr. Trump \\u201cnow rejects the crazy idea President Obama wasn\\u2019t born in America. \\u201d But he warned that this would not end the discussion. \\u201cThe problem he\\u2019ll have is that he was a leader of this movement,\\u201d Mr. Graham said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think he did the country a service, himself a service or the party a service by pushing this so hard and so long. \\u201d Democrats seized on Mr. Trump\\u2019s remarks as a litmus test for Republican candidates. \\u201cHe continues to disqualify himself, and yet Republican Senate candidates continue to stand by his side,\\u201d said Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. She said Republican candidates needed to say \\u201cif they think Donald Trump should apologize to the American people for the absurd lies he has spread about President Obama and why they continue to support a campaign that provides a safe harbor for this type of disgusting race baiting. \\u201d Mr. Trump took no questions after his remarks about Mr. Obama. As reporters shouted questions, he smiled and left the room. Not long after, the structure holding up the curtain that had provided a backdrop for his remarks collapsed, sending American flags toppling to the ground. No one was hurt.\",\n          \"\\u2039 \\u203a Arnaldo Rodgers is a trained and educated Psychologist. He has worked as a community organizer and activist. South Jersey veterans have miles to go for better care By Arnaldo Rodgers on November 1, 2016 veterans \\nBY VINCENT JACKSON \\nPhil Cinquina, who served in the Army in the 1940s, makes it a priority to maintain his health by working out several times a week. \\nCinquina, 89, has been more fortunate than other members of his American Legion Post in Weymouth Township. He said he can\\u2019t understand why veterans with health problems can\\u2019t get help locally. \\nInstead, to visit a VA hospital, local veterans have to travel by bus or van hours away to Pennsylvania, Delaware or northern New Jersey. \\n\\u201cIn Northfield, you have to catch the bus, and it\\u2019s a two-hour ride to the hospital. They will go on the bus together. Everybody has to wait until everyone on the bus is done (seeing a doctor), and then it comes back,\\u201d Cinquina said. \\nRead the Full Article at www.pressofatlanticcity.com >>>>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
